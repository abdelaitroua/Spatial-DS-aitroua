Ideas for queries:
1 - Find the most populated city closest to the latest recorded active volcano and recommend all airports for a 100 miles

2 - Use https://openflights.org/data.html to recommend a route ,based on a chosen prefferd airline, from wichita falls to a volcanic site based on chosen continent
 example function would be get_route(united, asia)

3 - download the active database of the most recent active volcanos and cross reference it to earthquakes within 200 mile radius of that area within a year before and after
    we are trying to determin if an earth quick preceeds eruptions or vise versa and create a warning for the locals.
